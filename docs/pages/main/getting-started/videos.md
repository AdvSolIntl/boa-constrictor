It walks through limitations with other patterns, the Screenplay Pattern's design, and how to make Screenplay calls with Boa Constrictor.
It's a great video to watch if you are new to Boa Constrictor.

[Pandy Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda)
converted a SpecFlow project to use Boa Constrictor:
