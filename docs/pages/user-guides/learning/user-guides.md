The best way to start learning about Boa Constrictor and the Screenplay Pattern is by
watching the [videos]({{ "/getting-started/videos/" | relative_url }})
or taking the [tutorial]({{ "/tutorial/overview/" | relative_url }}).
Those resources, however, do not cover *everything* you can do with Boa Constrictor.

The **User Guides** provide additional documentation on Boa Constrictor's many facets.
The sidebar to the left provides links to user guides for various topics,
such as integrating Boa Constrictor with popular .NET test frameworks.
Each user guide is written to concisely cover one concern.
The collection of user guides together should provide comprehensive documentation
in a way that can easily scale as the project grows.
